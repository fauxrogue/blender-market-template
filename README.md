## Getting Started

-   Run the `index.html` page.
-   Ensure that whatever page you're working on is uncommented in the `index.html`
    file.
-   By default `_page1.html` is active uncommented.
-   Test by commenting out `_page1.html` and uncommenting `_page2.html`.
-   Edit the contents of `_page1.html` or `_page2.html` and save to view changes.
    -   Or make your own page
        and make ensure that it's referenced in the `index.html` file.
